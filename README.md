# Metacognitive-Reading-Strategies
## Objective and Purpose 
Building on the premise that metacognitive reading strategies are pivotal in developing proficient readers, this study delves into students’ awareness and control over their own cognitive processes during reading. The study tests an array of variables including demographic information, teacher-guided reading activities, students’ attitudes towards reading and their habits, self-guided metacognitive activities, school characteristics, and self-assessment of reading skills. Our aim is to predict the range of metacognitive reading strategies employed by students and identify potential influences and patterns among these strategies. 

This study’s findings will enrich the field of education by delivering an empirically grounded model that explains the relationship between various influential factors and metacognitive reading strategies. This will aid in developing hypotheses regarding variations in the use of these strategies among students and offer criteria for designing future studies addressing the causes of these differences.  

## Perspectives or Theoretical Framework
This study, drawing on various theoretical perspectives, investigates the complex nature of reading proficiency. The importance of reading practices, motivation, attitudes, and metacognitive awareness form the foundation of this research. Skilled readers consistently employ a range of strategies to decipher, locate, and evaluate text information (2018 PISA Framework, 2020; Dansereau, 2014). The context and purpose of reading significantly influence strategy selection (Kim, 2020). We incorporate the Direct and Indirect Effects Model of Reading (DIER) by Kim (2020), elucidating the hierarchical and dynamic relationships within reading comprehension. 

Metacognition, as mentioned in the PISA rationale, signifies one’s awareness of their cognitive processes and their strategic approach to reading tasks (2018 PISA Framework, 2020), further corroborated by many other studies (e.g., Chen et al., 2021; Lepola et al., 2020). The interaction between metacognition and reading is multifaceted, influenced by social factors such as gender, socioeconomic status, and social media use (Koyuncu et al., 2022). Our investigation taps into these complexities using the comprehensive dataset from PISA 2018’s student, school, and parent questionnaires, aiming to predict the range of metacognitive reading strategies employed by students and identify potential influences and patterns. 

Further inquiry delves into the relationship between intrinsic motivation and the use of metacognitive strategies. Research indicates a clear interplay between these factors, as intrinsic motivation indirectly affects reading comprehension through the extent of reading and knowledge of strategy use (Miyamoto et al., 2019). The positive correlation between the application of metacognitive strategies and reading motivation amplifies this relationship (Ozturk & Aydogmus, 2021). Alongside, the concept of self-regulated learning (SRL), integral to metacognition, plays a crucial role in this study, highlighting its influence on learning efficiency (Efklides & Metallidou, 2020; Wang & Sperling, 2020). 

PISA’s theoretical framework, incorporating the Snow and RAND group’s (2002) reading comprehension approach, underscores the interplay of three sources: the reader, the text, and the activity. This approach emphasizes the importance of the reader’s inherent factors, such as motivation and prior knowledge, and their interaction with text and task factors (2018 PISA Framework, 2020). Contemporary theories portraying reading as a context-specific, goal-oriented activity further inform this study (e.g., Britt & Rouet, 2012). 

Finally, acknowledging potential pitfalls of secondary data analyses, such as sampling bias, this study proactively employs robust methods to mitigate them (Schneider et al., 2007). Backed by PISA’s standing, the findings derived from this study bear significant implications for education reform. They offer practical recommendations to enhance instruction and improve student achievement outcomes, thereby providing valuable insights for educators and policymakers alike.
